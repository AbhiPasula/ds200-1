# Research Method (DS200)

This repository is dedicated to the Module 4 of the DS200.


## Environment used
1. Python 3 is used for completing this assignment.
2. All experiments are performed in the google colab and can be regenerated.
3. Libraries used: pandas, numpy, matplotlib.


## How to run
1. Download the zipfile and run ResearchMethod_M4.ipynb on google colab or jupyter notebook and there is also a python researchmethod_m4.py file available.

## Dataset 
The data is also available publicly at <https://data.gov.in>. This is the Rainfall data from 1901-2017 based on states, months and annually and all the pllots are made using this dataset. 

## R&D Expenditure Per Capita and as Percentage of GDP for Selected Countries 2009 (in US$)

**a. Scatter Plot**

![Per capita GDP vs per capita investment in R&D](images/fig1.png)

**Observation:** The scatter plot above shows the correlation between per capita GDP and investment in R&D for different countries. We observe that countries with higher GDP have higher investments into R&D.

## GDP and Major Industrial Sectors of Economy

**b. Box Plot**

![Variability in contribution of different sectors to total GDP from 1951-2012](images/fig2.png)

**Observation:** From the plot we observe that the min, max and median values of the service sector is higher than those of any other sector. This shows that service sector on an average has higher contribution to the total GDP. The sectors associated to agriculture also have a substantial contribution towards the GDP but they also have much larger variability. The mining and manufacturing industries consistently have a smaller contribution to the GDP.

**c. Line Plot**

![Trend in contribution of different sectors to total GDP from 1951-2012](images/fig3.png)

**Observation:** The above line plot shows the trend in contribution of different sectors to the total GDP. This trend is not visible in box plot. From the above plot we see that over the years the contribution of agriculture sectors to GDP has declined while that of service sector has increased. The contribution of mining and quarring has almost remained constant over the years whereas the manufacturing and industrial sectors contibution has grown at a very low rate.
