3. Libraries used: pandas, numpy, matplotlib.


## How to run
1. Download the zipfile and run ResearchMethod_M4.ipynb on google colab or jupyter notebook and there is also a python researchmethod_m4.py file available.

## Dataset 
The data is also available publicly at <https://data.gov.in>. This is the Rainfall data from 1901-2017 based on states, months and annually and all the pllots are made using this dataset. 

## Sub Divisional Monthly Rainfall from 1901 to 2017 in India

**a. Scatter Plot**

![Amount of Rainfall vs Years(from 1901-2017)](images/rainfall_months_all.png)

**Observation:** The scatter plot above shows the comparision between the different season of months based on the amount of rainfall. So we can easily conclude that June and July month have more rain than other.

**c.1 Line Plot**

![Cumulative rainfall for Lakshadweep](images/line_plot_cum_laks.png)

**Observation:** The line plot shows the cumulative line plot for the Lakshadweep Union territory from 1901 to 2017 and it is observed that July have the most rainfall and Feburary have the least in the territory.

**c.2 Line Plot**

![Cumulative rainfall for India](images/line_plot_cum_all.png)
